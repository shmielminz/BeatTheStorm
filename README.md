## The Game

### The Start
The game starts with all players in middle spot, there are 50 spots up, and 50 spots down, you pick a card, to move up or down on board.

You need to take care not to get caught in the Storm, and not to drop to -50, and to move up to +50.

## The Winner or Looser:
Once a player reaches +50, the player takes one more turn, and if player gets a plus turn, that player is the Winner.

And same is for looser, if a player gets to -50, the player takes one more turn, and if player gets another minus turn, that player is the Looser.
