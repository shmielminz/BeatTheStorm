# Beat The Storm
Beat the Storm is a game similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_ladders">Snakes and ladders</a>, where you challenge yourself against your friend or the computer, who will beat the storm of technology first, and get first to 50 שערי קדושה, or who will fail to fight the storm, and drop to below 50 שערי טומאה.

## The Game
Once you choose the second player, you choose the playing mode, you have 2 options.
1.	Card Only.
2.	Dice with a Random Card.

### Card Only:
When playing in card only mode. You get a random card, which can be a השומרים card, or a Technology card, each card has a value, which is the number of moves you should take, but השומרים card gives you moves up, while Technology card gives you moves down.
You start in middle of board, there are 50 steps up, and 50 steps down. Each step represents a different שער, the 50 up are the 50 שערי קדושה, while 50 down is 50 שערי טומאה.

Once you pick a random card, you get a value, and if card was a השומרים card, you go up the value returned from card, and if card was Technology card, you move down the value returned from card.

### Dice with a Random Card:
You throw the dice, and you get the value of moves to go, but to know if you should move up or down, you need to pick a random card. Cards will be same as card only mode, the only difference is, that the number of moves you get from dice, rather than from card value.

And card will determine if you should go up or down, and if card was a השומרים card, you go up the value returned from dice, and if card was Technology card, you move down the value returned from dice.

## The Winner or Looser:
Once a player reaches +50, the player takes one more turn, and if player gets a plus turn, that player is the Winner.

And same is for looser, if a player gets to -50, the player takes one more turn, and if player gets another minus turn, that player is the Looser.
